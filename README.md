The personal information is stored and if the given member has been registered to use
WordPress via WordPress user, they can change their personal settings.
Also martial art grades and membership payments are stored.

please see [`readme.txt`](./readme.txt),

Minimum PHP version supported is `5.4.0`.

## Development

Docker utilising environment made originally by
https://medium.com/soluto-engineering/testing-wordpress-plugins-can-be-fun-d926a20452b0


## Publishing to the WordPress Plugin Repository (Subversion)

[Detailed background here](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-to-use-subversion/).

Clean checkout:

```sh
svn co https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/member-register wordpress-member-register
```

Or in an existing checkout:

```sh
svn up
```

Now delete all contents from `wordpress-member-register/trunk/`, copy everything from `WP-Member-Register/src/` to `wordpress-member-register/trunk/` and commit.
Follow by creating a version folder under `wordpress-member-register/tags/`, such as `0.22.7` and copy all contents of `wordpress-member-register/trunk/` to there, commit.

In case there has been changes to anything under `WP-Member-Register/assets/`, then also copy those over,
but they go to `wordpress-member-register/assets/`

Remember: Whatever ends up under `wordpress-member-register/tags/` should also be tagged in this git repository, prefixed with `v` as in version.
